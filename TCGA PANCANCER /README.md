# TCGA PANCANCER DATASET 
### This is a RNA-Seq (HiSeq) PANCAN data set gotten from UCI machine learning repository. It is a random extraction of gene expressions of patients having different types of tumor.


 Analysis performed on the dataset included:
***
1. *Normalization*
***
2. *Dimensionality reduction* using Principal Component Analysis
3. *Clustering* with Leiden algorithm and Visualization using  T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)
4. *Differential Gene Expression* using wilcoxon method and Visualization using (Dendrogram, Heatmap, Violinplot, and Matrix plot).
